Traffic Violation Notice Handling - Improvement Plan

Problem
- The authority sends tickets by mail to the rental car company, not the driver.
- Mail is forwarded to the office, then manually sorted, scanned, and emailed.
- One person cannot handle the volume consistently or quickly.

Goals
- Reduce manual sorting and scanning workload.
- Notify the responsible employee faster and track acknowledgement.
- Maintain an audit trail for compliance and payment deadlines.

Short-term (1-2 weeks)
1) Standardize intake:
   - Use a single intake mailbox and daily batch scanning (ADF scanner).
   - Apply a simple intake form to capture minimal metadata:
     received_date, due_date, vehicle_plate, violation_type, amount.
2) Central storage:
   - Save scans to a shared folder with a naming rule:
     YYYYMMDD_plate_violationtype_amount.pdf
3) Basic tracking:
   - Maintain a shared sheet to log each notice and status.

Medium-term (1-2 months)
1) Routing automation:
   - Maintain a vehicle-to-employee mapping file (CSV or small DB).
   - Use OCR to read the plate and due date from scans.
   - Auto-create an email draft to the employee and manager.
2) Acknowledgement workflow:
   - Require the employee to confirm receipt via form/link.
   - Send reminders 3, 1, and 0 days before due date.

Long-term (3-6 months)
1) Electronic delivery:
   - Ask the rental car company or authority for e-notice options.
   - If possible, receive digital notices directly to a shared inbox.
2) Outsourced mailroom:
   - Consider a scanning service if volume continues to grow.

Target Process (ASCII flow)
Authority -> Rental Company -> Office Intake -> Scan/OCR -> Auto-Route Email
           -> Employee Acknowledgement -> Payment/Dispute -> Archive

Minimum Data Model
- notice_id
- received_date
- due_date
- vehicle_plate
- driver_email
- violation_type
- amount
- status (new, notified, acknowledged, paid, closed)

KPIs
- Average time from receipt to notification
- % notices acknowledged within 24 hours
- Manual effort hours per week

Risks/Controls
- OCR errors: require manual validation on low-confidence scans.
- Missed deadlines: automated reminders and escalation to manager.
